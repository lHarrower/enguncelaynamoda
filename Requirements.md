# Requirements Document - AYNAMODA Project Completion

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing the AYNAMODA premium fashion application that embodies "Confidence as a Service" through a Digital Zen Garden philosophy. The project has evolved from initial concept to a sophisticated foundation with working core systems.

**Project Evolution Status**:

- **Foundation Phase**: âœ… COMPLETED - Unified DesignSystem, BentoBox layouts, EfficiencyScore service, navigation architecture
- **Implementation Phase**: âœ… COMPLETED - APP_THEME_V2 migration, component standardization, service integration
- **Polish Phase**: âœ… COMPLETED - Performance optimization, accessibility, testing, quality assurance
- **Feature Development Phase**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS - Core feature UI implementation, AI-powered features

**Key Architectural Achievements**:

- Comprehensive DesignSystem.ts with Digital Zen Garden aesthetic (#FAF9F6 base, sage/gold accents)
- Working BentoBox dashboard with StudioHomeScreen implementation
- Complete EfficiencyScore service with database integration and useEfficiencyScore hook
- Expo-router navigation with proper screen organization
- ThemeProvider context system with DesignSystemType integration
- Animation system with SPRING curves and React Native Reanimated

**Remaining Challenges**:

- âœ… COMPLETED: APP_THEME_V2 migration to DesignSystem
- âœ… COMPLETED: Legacy theme file conflicts (StudioTheme, UltraPremiumTheme) cleanup
- Missing UI implementations (visual onboarding, discover screen, wardrobe grid)
- Incomplete AI-powered features (wardrobe naming, style DNA generation)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Legacy System Cleanup & Modernization

**User Story:** As a lead developer, I want to eliminate conflicting legacy systems and standardize on the unified DesignSystem, so that the codebase is maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. âœ… COMPLETED: WHEN removing legacy themes THEN the system SHALL delete all conflicting theme files (âœ… StudioTheme.ts, âœ… UltraPremiumTheme.ts, âœ… AppThemeV2.ts, specialized themes) while preserving the working DesignSystem.ts
2. âœ… COMPLETED: WHEN migrating component imports THEN the system SHALL update all components to use `import { DesignSystem } from '@/theme/DesignSystem'` instead of legacy theme imports
3. WHEN cleaning file structure THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate folders (root components/ vs src/components/) and legacy files (\_\*\_legacy.tsx)
4. WHEN validating architecture THEN the system SHALL confirm that expo-router navigation, ThemeProvider context, and DesignSystem integration remain functional after cleanup

### Requirement 2: Design System Enhancement & Component Standardization âœ… COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a UI/UX designer, I want to enhance the existing DesignSystem and ensure consistent component implementation, so that the app achieves premium aesthetic quality with "Spotify's clean structure," "Gucci's polished luxury," and "calm wellness" feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN enhancing the DesignSystem THEN it SHALL extend the existing comprehensive system (#FAF9F6 base, sage/gold accents, Playfair Display + Inter typography) with missing component style definitions
2. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN standardizing components THEN it SHALL create unified Button, Input, Card, and Navigation component styles within the DesignSystem while maintaining existing glassmorphism and elevation systems
3. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN optimizing layouts THEN it SHALL enhance the working BentoBox system performance and complete the Collage layout implementation for discovery screens
4. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN ensuring consistency THEN it SHALL validate that all components use DesignSystem tokens instead of hardcoded values while preserving the Digital Zen Garden philosophy
5. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN defining interactions THEN it SHALL leverage existing SPRING animations and React Native Reanimated integration for consistent motion design

### Requirement 3: Missing Feature Implementation & Integration

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to complete the missing core features and integrate them with existing services, so that users have a complete premium fashion experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing visual onboarding THEN it SHALL build upon the existing OnboardingService and OnboardingFlow components to create a photo upload interface for Style DNA generation
2. WHEN building the discover screen THEN it SHALL integrate the complete EfficiencyScore service with a Tinder-style swipe interface using the existing Collage layout system
3. WHEN completing the wardrobe feature THEN it SHALL implement a grid-based interface with photo upload functionality and integrate AI-powered automatic naming service
4. WHEN creating the profile screen THEN it SHALL use existing userPreferencesService and auth context to build a clean settings management interface
5. WHEN ensuring feature integration THEN it SHALL validate seamless data flow between all services (onboarding â†’ wardrobe â†’ efficiency scoring â†’ discovery)

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Intelligence & Personalization

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered features that help me maximize my wardrobe efficiency and discover my personal style, so that I can make confident fashion choices aligned with the anti-waste philosophy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Style DNA generation THEN it SHALL analyze uploaded outfit photos to create personalized style profiles using computer vision and machine learning algorithms
2. WHEN building AI wardrobe naming THEN it SHALL automatically categorize and name clothing items from photos with manual override capability for user corrections
3. WHEN integrating efficiency algorithms THEN it SHALL leverage the existing EfficiencyScore service to calculate outfit combinations and provide personalized recommendations
4. WHEN creating personalized discovery THEN it SHALL use Style DNA and wardrobe data to filter and rank fashion items by compatibility and efficiency potential
5. WHEN ensuring intelligence continuity THEN it SHALL maintain learning from user interactions to improve recommendations over time

### Requirement 5: Performance, Accessibility & Quality Assurance âœ… COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want to ensure the application meets premium standards for performance, accessibility, and user experience, so that all users can confidently use the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN optimizing performance THEN it SHALL implement image lazy loading, bundle optimization, and memory management while maintaining 60fps animations using existing React Native Reanimated integration
2. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN ensuring accessibility THEN it SHALL validate WCAG AA compliance with DesignSystem colors, implement screen reader support, and ensure proper touch target sizes
3. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN testing quality THEN it SHALL expand the existing test suite (**tests**/ directory) to cover new UI components and validate DesignSystem consistency across all implementations
4. âœ… COMPLETED - WHEN validating user experience THEN it SHALL ensure smooth navigation between screens, proper error handling using existing ErrorBoundary and ErrorHandlingService, and graceful loading states
