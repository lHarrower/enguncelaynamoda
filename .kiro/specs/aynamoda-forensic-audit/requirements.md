# Requirements Document - AYNAMODA Project Completion

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing the AYNAMODA premium fashion application that embodies "Confidence as a Service" through a Digital Zen Garden philosophy. The project has evolved from initial concept to a sophisticated foundation with working core systems.

**Project Evolution Status**:

- **Foundation Phase**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (85%) - Unified DesignSystem, BentoBox layouts, EfficiencyScore service, navigation architecture
- **Implementation Phase**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS (40%) - Theme cleanup, UI completion, feature integration
- **Polish Phase**: ‚è≥ PENDING (15%) - Performance optimization, accessibility, testing

**Key Architectural Achievements**:

- **Design System**: Comprehensive DesignSystem.ts with 500+ tokens, Digital Zen Garden aesthetic (#FAF9F6 base, sage/gold accents)
- **Layout Systems**: Production-ready BentoBox (StudioHomeScreen), Collage (discovery), Grid (wardrobe) implementations
- **Service Layer**: Complete EfficiencyScore service with database integration, useEfficiencyScore hook, OnboardingService with StylePreferenceQuestionnaire
- **Navigation**: Expo-router with proper screen organization and deep linking support
- **State Management**: ThemeProvider context system with DesignSystemType integration, AuthContext for user management
- **Animation Framework**: SPRING curves with React Native Reanimated, gesture handling ready for swipe interfaces
- **Error Handling**: ErrorBoundary components and ErrorHandlingService for graceful failure management

**Technical Debt & Remaining Challenges**:

- **Legacy Theme Conflicts**: 6 conflicting theme files (StudioTheme, UltraPremiumTheme, AppThemeV2, Artistry, Atmospheric, Editorial)
- **Component Migration**: ~40 components still using legacy theme imports instead of unified DesignSystem
- **Missing UI Implementations**: Visual onboarding interface, Tinder-style discover screen, wardrobe grid with AI naming
- **AI Features**: Style DNA generation, automatic wardrobe naming, personalized recommendations need implementation
- **File Structure**: Duplicate folders (root components/ vs src/components/), legacy files scattered throughout project

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Legacy System Cleanup & Modernization

**User Story:** As a lead developer, I want to eliminate conflicting legacy systems and standardize on the unified DesignSystem, so that the codebase is maintainable, consistent, and ready for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing legacy themes THEN the system SHALL systematically delete 6 conflicting theme files (StudioTheme.ts, UltraPremiumTheme.ts, AppThemeV2.ts, ArtistryTheme.ts, AtmosphericTheme.ts, EditorialTheme.ts) while preserving the production-ready DesignSystem.ts with 500+ design tokens
2. WHEN migrating component imports THEN the system SHALL update ~40 components to use standardized `import { DesignSystem } from '@/theme/DesignSystem'` pattern and validate visual consistency through automated regression testing
3. WHEN cleaning file structure THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate folders (root components/ vs src/components/), delete legacy files (\_\*\_legacy.tsx), and consolidate AYNAMODA_V2 duplicates while maintaining import resolution
4. WHEN validating architecture THEN the system SHALL confirm that expo-router navigation, ThemeProvider context, DesignSystem integration, and all existing functionality remain operational through comprehensive integration testing
5. WHEN measuring cleanup success THEN the system SHALL achieve zero legacy theme imports, 100% DesignSystem usage, and maintain existing component functionality with improved maintainability metrics

### Requirement 2: Design System Enhancement & Component Standardization

**User Story:** As a UI/UX designer, I want to enhance the existing DesignSystem and ensure consistent component implementation, so that the app achieves premium aesthetic quality with "Spotify's clean structure," "Gucci's polished luxury," and "calm wellness" feel while maintaining the Digital Zen Garden philosophy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enhancing the DesignSystem THEN it SHALL extend the existing comprehensive system (#FAF9F6 base, sage/gold accents, Playfair Display + Inter typography) with standardized component style definitions for Button, Input, Card, Navigation, and Loading states while maintaining semantic color mapping and accessibility compliance
2. WHEN standardizing components THEN it SHALL create unified component library with primary/secondary/luxury variants, integrate existing glassmorphism and elevation systems, and ensure consistent prop interfaces across similar components with proper TypeScript typing
3. WHEN optimizing layouts THEN it SHALL enhance the working BentoBox system performance for StudioHomeScreen, complete the Collage layout implementation for discovery screens with efficiency score integration, and validate Grid system responsiveness for wardrobe interface
4. WHEN ensuring consistency THEN it SHALL validate that 100% of components use DesignSystem tokens instead of hardcoded values, implement automated design token validation, and preserve the Digital Zen Garden philosophy through generous whitespace (zen: 64px, sanctuary: 96px)
5. WHEN defining interactions THEN it SHALL leverage existing SPRING animations and React Native Reanimated integration for consistent motion design, implement organic easing curves across all components, and ensure 60fps performance with accessibility preferences for reduced motion

### Requirement 3: Missing Feature Implementation & Integration

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to complete the missing core features and integrate them with existing services, so that users have a complete premium fashion experience that embodies "Confidence as a Service" and supports the anti-waste philosophy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing visual onboarding THEN it SHALL build upon the existing OnboardingService and OnboardingFlow components to create a full-screen photo upload interface for Style DNA generation, support 5-10 outfit photo uploads with drag-and-drop functionality, implement progress indicators with encouraging copy, and integrate with StylePreferenceQuestionnaire for comprehensive user profiling
2. WHEN building the discover screen THEN it SHALL integrate the complete EfficiencyScore service with a Tinder-style swipe interface using the existing Collage layout system, implement left/right gesture handling with react-native-gesture-handler, display efficiency score as prominent circular indicators, and provide product detail modals with boutique integration
3. WHEN completing the wardrobe feature THEN it SHALL implement a 2-3 column responsive grid interface using the existing Grid.ts system, integrate expo-image-picker for photo upload functionality, implement AI-powered automatic naming service with manual override capability, and provide floating search bar with glassmorphism effects
4. WHEN creating the profile screen THEN it SHALL use existing userPreferencesService and AuthContext to build a clean list-based settings interface, display user statistics (style confidence, wardrobe efficiency, usage patterns), implement luxury-styled toggle switches using DesignSystem, and provide account management functionality
5. WHEN ensuring feature integration THEN it SHALL validate seamless data flow between all services (onboarding ‚Üí wardrobe ‚Üí efficiency scoring ‚Üí discovery), implement cross-feature data sharing, ensure real-time updates across screens, and maintain data consistency through proper state management

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Intelligence & Personalization
