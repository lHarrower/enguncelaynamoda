# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AYNA Mirror Daily Ritual is the cornerstone feature of AYNAMODA - a "Confidence as a Service" platform that transforms the morning routine from decision fatigue into a confidence-building ritual. This system delivers personalized, weather-aware outfit recommendations at 6 AM daily, learns from user feedback to become increasingly personal, and creates an addictive loop that helps users feel ready for anything with what they already own.

The feature encompasses the complete confidence ecosystem: digital wardrobe management, AI-powered styling intelligence, daily notification delivery, outfit confidence tracking, and the core feedback loop that makes the AI more personal with every interaction.
