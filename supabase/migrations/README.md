## Running Migrations

### Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

If you have the Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Apply all migrations
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migration
supabase db push --include-all
```

### Manual Application

If you need to apply migrations manually through the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of each migration file
4. Execute them in order (001, then 002)

## Migration Dependencies

- These migrations assume you have Supabase Auth set up with the `auth.users` table
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured to work with Supabase Auth
- All tables are designed to work with the existing AynaModa authentication system

## Data Model Overview

```
auth.users (Supabase Auth)
├── wardrobe_items (enhanced with intelligence features)
├── user_preferences (notification and style settings)
├── daily_recommendations (daily outfit suggestions)
│   └── outfit_recommendations (individual outfit options)
│       └── outfit_feedback (user ratings and responses)
```

## Security

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with policies that ensure:

- Users can only access their own data
- Proper authentication is required for all operations
- Data integrity is maintained through foreign key constraints

## Performance

Indexes are created on frequently queried columns:

- User ID fields for fast user-specific queries
- Date fields for time-based queries
- Usage tracking fields for analytics queries
