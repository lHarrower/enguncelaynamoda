## AYNAMODA full-body audit – final report

This report consolidates the repository-wide audit, reconciles schema ↔ client ↔ Edge Functions, and delivers concrete fixes, a drift matrix, a security/performance review, and a punchy PR plan with a validation checklist. Evidence paths and ready-to-run commands are included. Artifacts referenced below live under `audit/`.

### executive summary

- Overall status: Stable with targeted risks removed. Contracts aligned; critical security gaps in Edge Functions closed; DB function drift fixed; AI data flow normalized.
- Biggest wins this cycle:
  - Fixed `calculate_item_compatibility` to use only real columns (`category`, `colors`, `tags`).
  - Hardened Edge Functions: `verify_jwt`, strict CORS, Authorization enforcement, SSRF guard for image URLs.
  - Consolidated AI outputs into `ai_analysis_data` JSONB. Category casing normalized to lowercase across write paths.
  - Defaulted `processed_image_uri` to `image_uri` when missing to unblock rendering.
- Remaining verifications: Validate Deno configs on deploy, run DB diagnostics in Supabase, and smoke-test deep links.

### category scores (0–10)

- Contracts: 8.5 – Fixed drift in functions and service writes; add one more pass on deep link config and any lingering enum casing.
- Security: 8 – `verify_jwt`, CORS tightening, Authorization gates, and SSRF guard in place; add secrets scanning + runtime log review.
- Data integrity: 8.5 – Lowercasing strategy and AI JSONB consolidation reduce divergence; backfill job optional.
- Reliability/observability: 6.5 – CI covers unit tests; add release smoke tests and error monitoring.
- Performance: 7.5 – Indexes present; quick checks for index usage recommended; add query plans for top endpoints.
- DevEx/CI-CD: 8 – Workflows exist; add Supabase migration check + Edge Functions deploy verification step.

### what changed in this audit

- Schema/function fixes:
  - `supabase/migrations/20250811_fix_calculate_item_compatibility.sql` replaces the function to rely on existing columns (`category`, `colors`, `tags`).
  - `supabase/migrations/20250811_rls_hardening.sql` ensures RLS + policies for efficiency tables idempotently.

- Edge Function hardening:
  - Centralized CORS with env-based origin allowlist: `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts`.
  - Enabled/verified `verify_jwt = true` for sensitive functions, and enforced Authorization header.
  - Added SSRF guard to functions that fetch external images (restrict to trusted storage domains).

- Client/service alignment:
  - `ai_analysis_data` JSONB is now the single sink for AI outputs (replacing scattered `ai_*` fields).
  - Category casing normalized to lowercase on writes.
  - `processed_image_uri` defaults to `image_uri` when not provided.
  - OpenAI client: disabled browser usage in production; prefer proxy via Edge Function.

Evidence artifacts: see `audit/REPO_TREE_FULL.txt`, `audit/MIGRATIONS_LIST.txt` for the current filesystem and migration ledger.

### drift matrix (source of truth → clients → edge)

- Wardrobe item media fields
  - Source (DB): `image_uri TEXT`, `processed_image_uri TEXT DEFAULT NULL`
  - Client: uses camelCase mapping; default to original when processed missing
  - Edge: no mutation; reads validated
  - Status: aligned; default behavior implemented in service

- Wardrobe categorization
  - Source: `category TEXT` with lowercase check; `subcategory TEXT` optional
  - Client: normalized to lowercase on writes
  - Edge: validates/normalizes to lowercase on input where applicable
  - Status: aligned; run backfill if legacy mixed-case exists

- AI analysis storage
  - Source: `ai_analysis_data JSONB` (per `20241201_add_item_naming.sql`)
  - Client: reads/writes consolidated JSONB; avoids deprecated `ai_*` columns
  - Edge: `ai-analysis` writes into JSONB, retains ownership checks
  - Status: aligned

- Compatibility function
  - Source: `calculate_item_compatibility(wardrobe_item_id UUID, candidate_item_id UUID)` now refers only to `category`, `colors`, `tags`
  - Client: calls via RPC or internal usage queries
  - Edge: no direct dependency beyond conventional reads
  - Status: fixed via `20250811_fix_calculate_item_compatibility.sql`

### security posture review

- Edge Functions
  - `verify_jwt = true` configured via per-function `config.toml` for sensitive endpoints (e.g., `ai-proxy`, `edit-wardrobe-item`, `analyze-products`, `ai-analysis`).
  - Authorization: functions require `Authorization: Bearer` and validate user ownership before updates.
  - CORS: centralized and restricted via `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` env in production.
  - SSRF: fetches of `image_url` restricted/validated to trusted origins (e.g., Supabase Storage).

- Database/RLS
  - RLS enabled across user-scoped tables; hardening migration ensures coverage for efficiency tables.
  - Grants: EXECUTE on functions for `authenticated` maintained.
  - Indexes: performance indexes present (see `005_performance_optimizations.sql`).

- Client secrets
  - OpenAI browser usage disabled in production; proxy preferred.
  - `.env.example` exists; ensure real secrets are not committed. `.env.production` present—confirm it’s excluded from builds.

### performance review (quick triage)

- Indexes: core tables indexed (created_at, owner/foreign keys). See `005_performance_optimizations.sql`.
- Next steps: capture EXPLAIN ANALYZE for top queries (wardrobe list, recommendations, compatibility) and review `pg_stat_statements`.

### ci/cd and reliability

- Workflows present: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`, `deploy.yml`.
- Additions recommended:
  - Step to run `supabase db lint` (or SQLFluff equivalent) on migrations.
  - Post-deploy smoke tests hitting Edge Functions with a short bearer token path using ephemeral user.
  - Sentry or similar error reporting for the app; Supabase Logs review in deploy job.

### issues fixed and where

- Non-existent column references in `calculate_item_compatibility`: fixed by `20250811_fix_calculate_item_compatibility.sql`.
- Edge Function CORS wide-open: centralized `cors.ts` with allowlist.
- Missing Authorization/verify_jwt: enforced across functions via config + handler checks.
- Potential SSRF: guarded functions that fetch images.
- AI column proliferation: standardized to `ai_analysis_data` JSONB.
- Category casing drift: normalized to lowercase on writes.
- `processed_image_uri` null rendering: defaulted to `image_uri` client-side.

### validation checklist (green-before-done)

- Build: App builds locally and CI passes
  - Status: Not executed here; run `npm run build` or EAS build in CI
- Lint/Typecheck: React Native + TS; Deno types for Edge Functions may warn in local IDE
  - Status: Acceptable; Deno deploy resolves types; optional: add `deno.json` for local editor
- Unit tests: Jest suite
  - Status: Run in CI; ensure new services/migrations don’t break mocks
- DB migrations: up-to-date and idempotent
  - Status: `audit/MIGRATIONS_LIST.txt` confirms presence; run `supabase db reset` in a scratch project if needed
- Edge Functions: secure and healthy
  - Status: Verify `verify_jwt` and CORS in the deployed environment
