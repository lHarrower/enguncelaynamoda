# AYNA MODA Privacy Policy (Mobile App)

_Last updated: 2025-08-14_

AYNA MODA helps users build confidence through personalized wardrobe intelligence. We minimize the data we collect and give users control.

## 1. Data We Collect

| Category                  | Examples                                    | Purpose                                           | Retention                                          | User Control                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Account & Auth            | Email (if provided), Supabase UID           | Authentication & sync                             | Until account deletion                             | Delete account request                                 |
| Wardrobe Items            | Images, category, colors, usage stats       | Generate recommendations                          | User controlled; deleted when item removed         | Delete / edit items                                    |
| Usage & Feedback          | Confidence ratings, emotional response tags | Model improvement & personalization               | Rolling 12 months (aggregate thereafter)           | Clear feedback history                                 |
| Device Context            | Timezone, platform, push token              | Notification scheduling & performance diagnostics | Push token rotated periodically; context ephemeral | Disable notifications                                  |
| Weather Context           | City (derived), temperature                 | Contextual outfit recommendations                 | Not stored long-term (cached < 24h)                | Disable location permission                            |
| Crash & Error Diagnostics | Stack traces, anonymized device info        | Stability & debugging                             | 30 days (crash), aggregated metrics longer         | Opt-out (disable crash reporting in settings, planned) |

We do NOT intentionally collect: precise geo coordinates beyond what is needed for weather (can be disabled), contact lists, payment data, biometrics, or advertising identifiers.

## 2. How Data Is Processed

- Client app gathers wardrobe data locally and syncs to Supabase (Postgres with Row Level Security).
- Recommendation logic queries wardrobe + feedback + weather context to produce daily sets.
- Feedback continuously tunes personalization signals.

## 3. Third Parties (Processors)

| Service    | Purpose                                 | Data Shared                                      | Location                                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Supabase   | Auth, database, storage, edge functions | Wardrobe records, feedback, auth metadata        | Regional (per Supabase region selected) |
| Cloudinary | Image storage (unsigned upload preset)  | Wardrobe images                                  | Global CDN                              |
| Sentry     | Crash/error telemetry                   | Stack traces, release & device metadata (no PII) | EU/US (per Sentry region)               |

## 4. Legal Bases (GDPR)

- Performance of contract: core functionality.
- Legitimate interest: crash diagnostics (minimized & opt-out planned).
- Consent: notifications, optional location-based weather (system prompts), AI personalization.

## 5. User Rights

- Access & Export: Provide export via support request (planned automated portal).
- Rectification: Edit wardrobe items directly.
- Erasure: Delete account (will purge wardrobe, feedback, tokens).
- Restrict / Object: Disable notifications, location.
- Data Portability: JSON export (planned).

## 6. Data Retention

| Data            | Retention                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Wardrobe items  | Until user deletion             |
| Feedback events | 12 months raw, then aggregated  |
| Crash logs      | 30 days                         |
| Cached weather  | <24h                            |
| Push tokens     | Rotate on re-login / OS refresh |

## 7. Security Measures

- Row Level Security policies enforced in database.
- Client sends only anon key; all privileged logic in edge functions.
- Input validation & rate limiting on edge endpoints (progressive rollout).
- Image uploads constrained by unsigned upload preset.

## 8. Children

Not directed to children under 13. If we learn of child data, we will delete it.

## 9. Changes

We will update this document and version it in the repository.
