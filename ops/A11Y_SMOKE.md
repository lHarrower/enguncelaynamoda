# Accessibility Smoke Test

Run this minimal pass each release to ensure no regressions in baseline accessibility support.

## 1. Launch & Global

- App launches without crash with TalkBack enabled.
- Dynamic text size (Largest) does not truncate critical CTAs on first 3 screens.

## 2. Authentication

- Login screen: All input fields have accessible labels.
- Error validation messages announced after submitting empty form.

## 3. Primary Flow (Mirror)

- Main mirror screen: Primary action buttons reachable via sequential navigation order.
- No focus traps when opening and dismissing modal overlays.

## 4. Color & Contrast

- Video / motion elements (if any) do not autoplay with sound.

## 6. Haptics & Motion

- Motion intensive transitions respect system Reduced Motion setting (if platform supported).

## 7. Keyboard / Switch (Android TV / Emulator)

- Basic navigation possible with D-Pad: focus clearly visible.

## 8. Screen Reader Specific

- No duplicate announcements on tab switch.
- Time-sensitive toasts are announced (or have accessible fallback region).
