## Summary
- **Bundle Size**: 6.69 MB
- **Status**: GOOD - Bundle size is within target
- **Dependencies**: 46
- **Source Files**: 383
- **Source Size**: 3.08 MB

## Recommendations

### Optimize large dependencies (MEDIUM priority)
Found 20 large packages that could be optimized

Actions:
- Review necessity of large packages
- Use tree shaking for libraries like lodash
- Consider lighter alternatives
- Implement dynamic imports for non-critical packages


### Optimize large source files (MEDIUM priority)
Found 3 large source files

Actions:
- Split large components into smaller ones
- Extract reusable logic into hooks
- Move constants to separate files
- Consider code splitting for large features


## Next Steps
1. Review the detailed analysis files in the bundle-analysis directory
2. Implement high-priority recommendations first
3. Re-run this analysis after optimizations to track progress
4. Set up automated bundle size monitoring in CI/CD
