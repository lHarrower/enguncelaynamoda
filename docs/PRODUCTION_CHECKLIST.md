   - If major issue: Rollback to previous version

3. **Communication**
   - Notify users if necessary
   - Update store descriptions
   - Post on social media if required

### Critical Issue Response
1. **Security Issues**
   - Immediately revoke compromised API keys
   - Deploy emergency patch
   - Notify affected users

2. **Data Issues**
