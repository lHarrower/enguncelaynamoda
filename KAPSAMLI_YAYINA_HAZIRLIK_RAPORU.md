# OPERATION: CONSTITUTION - The Final AYNAMODA Audit

**PRIME DIRECTIVE:**
You are to act as an impartial technical auditor. Your mission is to conduct the most comprehensive and deepest possible analysis of the entire AYNAMODA codebase and its production readiness. You will not fix any code. Your sole purpose is to analyze the project against the four pillars of quality defined below and generate a definitive, objective report. Fill in every section marked with `[ANALYZE AND REPORT]`.
